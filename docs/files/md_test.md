# Documents

An indispensable component in RAG applications is data, we have many different types of data such as: pdf, docx, csv, pptx, html, database... each type is different and does not follow any common standards. Therefore, Documents in Llama Index are created as a mold to contain and bring data types into a common structure.

The special feature in the structure of Documents is that it can contain additional information about the data in it, this component is called metadata. Simply put, it is additional information that we provide for data such as description, summary, title... this information is intended to support the search process more effectively.

To create a Document from data, the syntax is as follows: `Document(text, metadata, id_)`
Where:

    * text: input data in text format

    * metadata: metadata, usually in dictionary format, usually automatically generated by the library.

    * id_: The index of this Document object, it is usually automatically generated
